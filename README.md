# Data Engineering Course Projects

This repository contains the **projects and assignments** completed for the *Data Engineering* course at the **Department of Applied Computer Science, AGH University of Kraków**.

The repository contains **6 assignments**, each folder contains:
  - Source scripts (`.py`)  
  - PDF instructions for the assignment

## Assignment Overview

| Assignment | Main Topics | Key Skills / Tasks |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **1. Pandas Basics** | DataFrames, statistics, column normalization | Column info, compute stats, rename columns, export CSV/JSON/Excel/Pickle, flatten JSON |
| **2. Working with Data** | CSV/JSON processing, type conversion, one-hot encoding | Load complex CSVs, map textual scales, convert types, extract numbers, one-hot encoding |
| **3. Data Cleaning** | Missing data, joins, aggregation, reshaping | Merge JSONs, count missing, apply transformations, join datasets, pivot/melt, group and aggregate |
| **4. Spatial Data** | GeoPandas, OSMnx, spatial joins, visualization | Load GeoJSON, count nearby points, load OSM roads, spatial joins, export GeoJSON, render maps |
| **5. Time Series** | Time indexing, resampling, interpolation, alignment | Clean timestamped data, adjust frequency, downsample/upsample, resample cumulative data, align sensors |
| **6. Window Functions & SQLite** | SQLite database, window functions, moving windows | Import traffic dataset, compute detector stats, moving window (lag, sum), export results, optional DuckDB usage |

## Learning Outcomes

After completing these assignments, I have developed the ability to:  

- Analyze and manipulate structured and unstructured datasets using **Python, Pandas, and GeoPandas**  
- Perform **time series analysis** including resampling, upsampling, and alignment  
- Conduct **geospatial data analysis** with spatial joins and visualizations  
- Utilize **relational databases (SQLite, DuckDB)** and apply **window functions** for advanced queries  
- Clean, transform, aggregate, and reshape data for downstream analysis  
- Serialize and export data in **CSV, JSON, Pickle, and Excel** formats  
- Apply best practices for **data cleaning and normalization**
